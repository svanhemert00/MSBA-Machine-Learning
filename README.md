## CA-01: EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)

To view this assignment, dowload the .zip file containing the notebook, decompress it, and upload it to either JupyterLab or Google Colab.

This notebook goes through the process of cleaning, processing, and post-processing of a real estate dataset for future supervised modelling to predict housing prices. In doing so, I have coded in Pandas, NumPy, and created for loops to plot univariate, bivariate, and multivariate relationships between features using Matplotlib and Seaborn. The post-processing section uses some Scikit-Learn methods for standardization and normalization. At the end of the notebook, there is a section dedicated to testing out the AutoViz library for automated EDA, though the parameters for this library were not adjusted so the output is not clean. The notebook is properly titled and laid out and contains several comments that detail what the code is accomplishing.

I believe more EDA could have been carried out, but the process of EDA in an of itself is a never-ending rabbit hole of discoveries within your data.
