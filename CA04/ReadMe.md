# CA04 – Ensemble Models

## Brief description of the purpose of your program and what it is doing
1. This program detects whether someone's income is above or below $50K/yr based on demographic data
2. Trains a different ensemble algorithms on the train set and runs a for loop to test and plot different numbers of estimators, comparing how they perform in terms of accuracy and AUC across each models
3. The best accuracy and AUC per model is stored in a Pandas DataFrame

- `numpy`
- `re`
- `pandas`
- `sklearn`
- `pyplot` from `matplotlib`
- `sys`
