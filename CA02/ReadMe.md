# CA02: eMail Spam Classifers that uses Naive Bayes supervised machine learning algorithm

## - Brief description of the purpose of your program and what it is doing
1. This program reads spam and non-spam email text files from the directory
2. Splits all the words from the emails and adds them to a list from which stopwords, non-alphabetical characters, and one-letter words are removed, containing solely the most common 3000 words for the training set.
3. Trains a Naive Bayes classification algorithm on the train set
4. And compares predicted results versus actual results on the test set using classification evaluation metrics

## Libraries are needed in the environment to be able to run the code
- `os`
- `numpy`
- `Counter` from `collections`
- `pandas`
- `sklearn`
- `pyplot` from `matplotlib`

## What versions of various software/libraries are you using
- Python 3 (ipykernel)
- numpy==1.22.1
- pandas==1.4.0
- matplotlib==3.5.1

## What dataset are you using and their source
Provided train and test folders containing spam and non-spam email text files

## Acknowledgement and link to source code of anyone elseâ€™s code, if you are reusing them
Some of the markdown comments within the notebook, as well as code attempts at plotting a confusion matrix and a scatterplot graphing the Naive Bayes model using matplotlib were generated by ChatGPT

## How to install and run your code along with datasets to be able to run your program successfully
1. Download folder from GitHub containing Jupyter notebook ("CA02_NB_assignment"), the "train-mails" folder, and the "test-mails" folder
2. Upload folder to coding environment: Google Colab or Jupyterhub. Make sure the folders containing the text files are in the same directory as the notebook
3. Enter the path of your train-mails and test-mails folders in the `TRAIN_DIR` and `TEST_DIR`
4. Run notebook and view results
