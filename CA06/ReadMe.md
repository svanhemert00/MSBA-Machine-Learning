# CA06 - Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

## - Brief description of the purpose of your program and what it is doing
**Objective:** The aim of this assignment is to perform customer segmentation using the K-Means clustering algorithm in order to better understand the different types of customers in a given dataset.

Using the KMeans algorithm, we successfully clustered our data into 5 distinct groups. Our data exploration revealed a clear clustering pattern when we plotted Annual Income (k) against Spending Score (1-100) on a scatterplot. By visually inspecting the plot, we were able to identify 5 clusters.

To confirm our intuition, we calculated the silhouette score for different values of K and found that K=5 provided the best clustering solution. After running KMeans with K=5, we observed that the algorithm was able to effectively group the data into 5 distinct clusters, with each cluster having its own unique characteristics.
