# CA03 - Decision Tree Algorithm

## - Brief description of the purpose of your program and what it is doing
1. This program detects whether someone's income is above or below $50K/yr based on demographic data
3. Trains a Decision Tree Classifier algorithm on the train set and tests different hyperparameters, ultimately creating a Best Tree Classifier with optimal hyperparameters
4. Tests Best Decision Tree against new, unseen data
