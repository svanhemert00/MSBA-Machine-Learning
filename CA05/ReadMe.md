# CA05 – kNN Recommender

## - Brief description of the purpose of your program and what it is doing
This program trains a KNearestNeighbor Classifier on a very small subset of IMDB movie data and predicts the five nearest neighbors to the movie _The Post_. There is `Label` feature in our dataset, but the values are all 0's because we are not interested in differentiating between yes or no: we just want the 5 movies that most closely relate to our _The Post_.

In the interest of time, no hyperparameter tuning was performed nor tested to improve model performance.
